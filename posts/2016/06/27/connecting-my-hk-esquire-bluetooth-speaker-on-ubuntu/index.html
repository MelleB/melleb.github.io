    <p>Some time ago I got a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.harmankardon.com/bluetooth-speakers/ESQUIRE.html">HK Esquire Bluetooth Speaker</a> which is
actually a really nice, solid speaker. Pairing and connecting is easy
under Windows and Mac OS, but I couldn't get it to work on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>First, <a class="reference external" href="http://melleb.github.io/posts/2016/06/19/enable-internal-bluetooth-bcm2046b1-adapter-on-ubuntu/">I had some trouble getting my bluetooth adapter to work</a>,
after that the pairing worked, but I couldn't get the sound to work.
After trying several solutions metioned on different fora, the
solution was much simpler that I anticipated.</p>
<p>Part of the solution was to install the bluetooth module for
PulseAudio using</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt-get install pulseaudio-module-bluetooth
</pre></div>
<p>But that alone didn't fix the issue. After connecting to the speaker,
you need to kill/reset the pulseaudio deamon using</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pulseaudio -k
</pre></div>
<p>For some reason this makes the speaker show up in PulseAudio Volume
Control. My guess is that it resets the list of output devices. But I
might be wrong.</p>
<p>I got to choose between two audio profiles: <cite>High Fidelity Playback
(A2DP Sink)</cite> and <cite>High Fidelity Headset (HSP/HFP)</cite>. The sound output
of the High Fidelity Heaset profile was crap, which might be expected.
So I tried using the A2DP sink. It didn't work the first time, but
after trying it a week later it worked. Yay.</p>
